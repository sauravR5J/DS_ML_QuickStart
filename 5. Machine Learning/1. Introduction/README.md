# Machine Learning

To get a clear concept as well as the mathematics going behind the Machine Learning Algorithms it is highly recommended to go through the following video series:
1. Open the following link: https://www.youtube.com/user/dataschool/playlists
2. Scroll down and you will find a section called **Introduction to Statistical Learning**
3. Go through the lectures in the sequence shown.

Another reading material that I would recommend is Python Data Science Handbook. It covers all important topics in a very comprehensive way with examples.<br>
